Hot off the SouthEast Linux Conference, [Keith Bennett](https://twitter.com/keithrbennett) gave a talk on how to make writing Ruby more functional using lambdas. He's also open sourced a few projects on github, namely [rexe](https://github.com/keithrbennett/rexe), as well as contributing to the open source community. Thanks for coming down Keith!
