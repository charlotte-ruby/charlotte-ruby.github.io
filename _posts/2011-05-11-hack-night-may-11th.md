Come out and enjoy a great night of hacking code with fellow rubyists! We are meeting at [Area 15](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=&vps=5&jsv=236a&sll=35.232703,-80.825483&sspn=0.00702,0.013937&g=516+E+15th+St+Charlotte,+NC+28206&ie=UTF8&geocode=FTKcGQIddrMu-w&split=0) @ 7:00pm.

We should have a representative outside. Send [@cltrb](http://twitter.com/cltrb) a tweet if you can’t find anyone.

Hope to see you there!
