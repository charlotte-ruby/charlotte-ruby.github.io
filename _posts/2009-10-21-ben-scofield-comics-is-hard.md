[Ben Scofield](https://twitter.com/bscofield) from [Viget Labs](http://www.viget.com/) was nice enough to come down and give a talk to us last week. His talk goes into detail about how some problem domains do not map well to traditional relational databases. He also provides a lot of alternative ways to persist your data using technologies such as Redis, CouchDB, and MongoDB to name a few. I’ve post a video of the talk as well as Ben’s slides for anyone who wasn’t able to make it out.
