[Richard Schneeman](http://schneems.com/), Ruby Evangelist at Heroku, stopped by to talk about the [Twelve-Factor App](http://www.12factor.net/) method for building software applications. During the talk he covers bootstrapping, deploying, monitoring, and scaling up an application. [@scheems](https://twitter.com/schneems) covers how to develop these apps locally, store credentials securely in the cloud, and leverage existing services to use on Heroku.
