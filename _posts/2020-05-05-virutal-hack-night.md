We did our 2nd Virtual Meetup since the COVID-19 outbreak on Zoom. We had a roundtable discussion of Rails, Docker, Stimulus, and current open source contributions to the [charlotte ruby organization](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/). John gave a preview of an upcoming online talk he's planning on giving on [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org).

Thanks everyone for coming out! If you're interested in speaking or just dropping in and saying hi to a few friendly faces, check out our [events page](https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb/events/) over at meetup.com.
