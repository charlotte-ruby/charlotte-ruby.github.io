[Sean Cribbs](http://seancribbs.com/), lead developer of Radiant CMS and co-founder of [Lowdown](http://lowdownapp.com/) gave a great talk this month called Story-Driven Development with Cucumber. [Sean](http://twitter.com/seancribbs) gives a great tutorial on how Cucumber works as well as the benefits that go along with story-driven development. I’ve posted the talk as well as his slides here for anyone who wasn’t able to make it or would like to see it again. Sorry for the dark video; It’s hard keeping it dark enough for a projector while bright enough to film our speakers.
