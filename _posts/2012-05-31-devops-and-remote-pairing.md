A two-fisted presentation this month!

First up was [Jim Van Fleet](http://jimvanfleet.com/) of [@otherscreen](http://otherscreen.com/) and [@mocksup](http://mocksup.com/) fame to talk about the DevOps movement. He covered the principles, ideas, and methods behind automating your infrastructure using [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).

Our other presentation was by [Ben Vangrift](http://ben.vandgrift.com/) from [Revelance](http://thinkrelevance.com/). Ben went over the benefits of pair programming and how to setup a shared environment thatâ€™ll work in either a co-located or remote setup.
