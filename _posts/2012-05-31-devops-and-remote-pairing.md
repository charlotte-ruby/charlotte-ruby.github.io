A two-fisted presentation this month!

First up was [Jim Van Fleet](http://www.jimvanfleet.com/) of otherscreen and mocksup fame to talk about the DevOps movement. He covered the principles, ideas, and methods behind automating your infrastructure using [Chef](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

Our other presentation was by [Ben Vangrift](http://ben.vandgrift.com/) from [Revelance](http://thinkrelevance.com/). Ben went over the benefits of pair programming and how to setup a shared environment thatâ€™ll work in either a co-located or remote setup.
