A monthly meetup of fellow Rubyists. Come sit around the virtual campfire as we discuss ruby news, current projects people are working on, and provide help with questions you have. We're a group of friendly folks open to people of all background and experience levels. Whether you're a first timer or an experienced developer, come join us!

We meet the first Tuesday of every month. You can [RSVP here](https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb/events)
