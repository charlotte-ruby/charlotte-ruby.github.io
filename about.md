You’ve reached the home of the Charlotte Ruby Users Group, or cltrb for short. This site is currently a work in progress and is actively [being developed](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/charlotte-ruby.github.com/).

We’re a group of local Ruby enthusiasts who try to get together twice a month for lightning talks or a hack night. Check out our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb/) or follow [@cltrb](http://twitter.com/cltrb) on twitter for more info.
